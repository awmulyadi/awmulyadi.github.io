**"Halo, Dunia!"** is a direct Bahasa translation to the common unwritten ritual for all programmers. Borrowing that concept, hence, here on this very page, I hereby my first step to expose myself to the world, especially in the research on artificial intelligence (AI). As a striving scholar, I fancy myself standing on the shoulder of the giant to discover a broad scenery, that is AI landscape. I found myself exhausted yet delight in conducting research (Let put aside the tiring parts, and focus more on the joy part, shall we!). I enjoyed the research in the moment of a novel idea discovery, which expects to give a contribution and impact to the society. Hopefully, throughout these blog posts, I can share my knowledge about AI and stuff.

Regards,
