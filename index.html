            March 2024: Relocated to Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and joined the <a href="https://bio.mx/research-teams/artificial-intelligence/team-vpe/">Virtual Patient Engine (VPE) team</a> at the BioMed X Institute in Heidelberg. I am contributing to the development of a computational platform aimed at predicting the efficacy of first- or best-in-class drug candidates for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a project supported by Sanofi in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
